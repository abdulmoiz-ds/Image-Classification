# Image-Classification
Learn how to build an image classification model using Supervised Learning in this Data Science project. Enhance it with data augmentation and transfer learning

Gather Data: Collect a dataset of images that you want to classify. You can use public datasets such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, or create your own dataset by gathering images from the internet.

Preprocess Data: Preprocess the dataset by resizing images to a uniform size and normalizing pixel values to improve training efficiency.

Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

Build Model: Build a neural network using a framework such as Keras or TensorFlow to classify the images. You can use pre-trained models as a starting point or build your own architecture.

Train Model: Train the model using the training dataset and optimize the parameters of the neural network to achieve better performance.

Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model using the testing dataset and calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Improve Model: Use techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model.

Deploy Model: Deploy the model on a web application or mobile application to classify images in real-time.

By following these steps, you can build a powerful image classification model using Supervised Learning. Remember to document your progress and results throughout the process to demonstrate your understanding of the techniques used.
