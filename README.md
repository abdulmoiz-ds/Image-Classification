# Image-Classification
Learn how to build an image classification model using Supervised Learning in this Data Science project. Enhance it with data augmentation and transfer learning. You can follow this guide on [Image Classification](https://wisetechcat.com/image-classification/) for better understanding of code.

1. Gather Data: Collect a dataset of images that you want to classify. You can use public datasets such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, or create your own dataset by gathering images from the internet.

2. Preprocess Data: Preprocess the dataset by resizing images to a uniform size and normalizing pixel values to improve training efficiency.

3. Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

4. Build Model: Build a neural network using a framework such as Keras or TensorFlow to classify the images. You can use pre-trained models as a starting point or build your own architecture.

5. Train Model: Train the model using the training dataset and optimize the parameters of the neural network to achieve better performance.

6. Evaluate Model: Evaluate the model using the testing dataset and calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

7. Improve Model: Use techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the model.

8. Deploy Model: Deploy the model on a web application or mobile application to classify images in real-time.

By following these steps, you can build a powerful image classification model using Supervised Learning. Remember to document your progress and results throughout the process to demonstrate your understanding of the techniques used.
